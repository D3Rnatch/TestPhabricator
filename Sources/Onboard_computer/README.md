In this folder : all the sources for the raspberry pi.

Most of it is in python.

folders :
	- Network : everything related to the communication with the base station.
	- Scanner_laser : everything related to the scanning.

Files :
	- robot.py : main program.
	
Those sources are all for the onboard computer (raspberry pi).
We will maybe change it to C++ if python is too slow.
