In this folder : all the sources for the raspberry pi.

Most of it is in python.

folders :
  - network : everything related to the communication with the base station.
  - Scanner_laser : everything related to the scanning.
  - map : everything related to the map (FastSLAM and other).

Files :
  - robot.py : robot object (main object).
  - main.py : main program.
	
Those sources are all for the onboard computer (raspberry pi).

We will maybe change it to C++ if python is too slow (will see...).
